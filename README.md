## Code Overview

### HTML

The HTML structure consists of a form for adding tasks and a div for displaying the tasks. The form includes a text input field for the task description and a button for submitting the task. The task list div will be dynamically populated with tasks as they are added.

### CSS

The CSS file styles.css is linked in the HTML file. It provides styling for the page and the task list.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file index.js is linked at the end of the HTML file. It contains the functionality for adding, completing, and deleting tasks. It uses the DOM API to interact with the HTML elements.

## Future Improvements

- Save tasks in local storage so they persist after the page is refreshed.
- Add the ability to edit tasks.
- Add the ability to sort or filter tasks.
